\## General Observations



-Depending on the time of day different colors were brought out of the stop sign.

-The areas of highlight and shadow on the stop sign changed depending on the time of day. 

-The selective visibility of principle of lighting help to conceal or bring out certain details of the stop sign depending on what time of day I was observing it.



\## Morning Observations



-During the morning the upper part of the octagon was in shadow while the lower part was in highlight though this difference was not dramatic in the morning.

-The cris cross texture was visible on the letters, but not on the red part of the stop sign.

-The metal nuts had a bit of a gleam to them during this time of day.

-A medium level of color was brought out from the pole of the stop sign.

-The stop sign at this time of day gives a very sign you see while riding on a school bus 

on the way to school feel to us.

\## Midday Observations



-On day 1 an absolute ton of color was brought out of the stop sign. While a great deal of color was brought out on day 2 not to the same extend as day one.

-While you can see the cris cross texture across the stop sign on day 1 you cannot on day 2.

-The shadow is located at the bottom, and the highlight is located at the top on both days. However, the shadow extends a lot higher on day two than it does on day one.

-The likely variation from day to day is likely due to changes in environmental factors such as positioning of clouds.

-In the photo for the midday observations you can see the stop sign casting a shadow onto the ground and pavement which it does not do as dramatically in any other photo. Only a little bit in the morning photo and a not at all in the night photo. This is likely due the angle that which the light is hitting the stop sign.

\## Nightime Observations



-The entire stop sign is cloaked in a veil of shadow at nighttime. Giving off a very ominous feeling to it.

-With it hard to make out many of the specific details on the stop sign at all. To the extent I almost forgot to draw the metal nuts when doing my sketch of the stop sign due to how much my visibility was not focused towards them.

-The light from the nearby streetlamp gives a shimmer fuzzy edge to the edge of the stop sign.

-Even with how dark it is out. There are still areas of highlight and shadow within the red of the stop sign.

\## How the Look Might Be Achieved on Stage



-In terms of all the different experiences of the stop sign. All the changed was the overall intensity and angle of the light. With that so many different experiences of the stop sign were able to be achieved. The two day time looks with some level of light everywhere with light hitting more intensely from one particular angle. Where as with the nighttime look most of the stage is enveloped in low or even cool lighting with just a few small areas of intense white light mostly it looks like back lighting hitting said stop sign.
