Much of the play is intentionally silent bar predicated sound cues. Reflecting the all-consuming void that is the boring unending nightmare the Hedda can not escape from.  With one notable exception the gunshot at the end of the play with is at a volume level no other sound cue is at reflecting the actual gravity of Hedda taking her own life. The preshow music which is additionally used for intermission and curtain call music on the other hand contrasts the internal play music in that it is lively and upbeat. Both reflecting the life that which Hedda so desperately longs for and reflecting the party which at one point in the play a lot of the characters abandon Hedda to go to.

While there is no theatrical speaker design as there is no set design or blocking to work with here to guide that. I envision a theatrical speaker designer with you here sound logically coming from the place it would realistically come from. A very realism style of speaker design so to speak.
