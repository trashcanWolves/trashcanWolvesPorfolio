## Lighting Design Concept Statement:

Copland Appalachian Spring is a story about a growing beanstalk grown through magic slowly brining a family of mice to unite with a family of cats in a celebration.

## Story:

-Moment 1 Story: There is a seed of an ungrown beanstalk in a grassy field

-Moment 1 Music: Slow melody that goes back and forth

-Moment 2 Story: Duck uses duck wizard magic on the beanstalk to start the beanstalk to rapidly grow piercing the cloud. There is a windmeal in fiels background

-Moment 2 Music: Rapid increase of melody that starts with drum crash. The rapid upstepping meldoy reminds me of music stylistically that might accompy the background of a windmill town

-Moment 3 Story:Beanstalk slowly wavers in the wind

-Moment 3 Music: Melody takes on a more gentle tone

-Moment 4 Story: Tiny playfull mice running around and playing on a beanstalk

-Moment 4 Music: Melody increases tempo. A marching nature to the music.

-Moment 5 Story: Beanstalk once again growining

-Moment 5 Music: Music growing. Melody Continues.

-Moment 6 Story: Tiny mice now in clouds going to visit their cat friends in the cat castle in the clouds.

-Moment 6 Music: Evolution of previous section of music. Triangle part in music possibily.

-Moment 7 Story: Feast

-Moment 7 Music: Very grand and strong conclusion with all insturments come together.
