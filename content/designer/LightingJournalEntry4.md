## Prompt

## Lighting Design Concept Statement:
Divernire is a journey through the memories of a past long since forgetten in the wirlwind of chaos and the passage of time of a Swan boat in a park.
General Approach for Lighting Design for this Piece of Music:
As a listened to this. This is the story that we visualized as what the music would look like. Like for us if this music were to be given physical form this is what this music would be. We invisioned this music as a park that had a lake and this lake happened to have a swan boat within it.


## Story:
-Moment 1 Story: There is a Swarn Boat in the Lake
-Moment 1 Music: Substained Starting Melody of Music
-Moment 2 Story: Shadows of Traingles Covered the Stage
-Moment 2 Music: Some of the instruments vanish from the music in a very rapid rhythm portion of the song.
-Moment 3 Story:Marble titles on a park pavement walkway
-Moment 3 Music: Piano solo
-Moment 4 Story: Return of Swan boat but with no water
-Moment 4 Music: Reptition in section of the music from earlier
-Moment 5 Story: A swirl of memories from past in a tornado surronding a brain filled with pulsating brain nervous system.
-Moment 5 Music: Repetition of an earlier part of music but with a greater intensity, volume, and chaos to it than earlier
-Moment 6 Story: Return to the swan boat from earlier but with a rapid fade out
-Moment 6 Music: Return reptition of earlier part of music but with rapid ending to the music

## Lighting Cues:
-Cue 1 & 2: Green Wash Upper 10% of Stage Blue Wash Bottom 90% of Stage Spotlight of Whitelight on Orchastra Cue time: 5 Seconds For Cue to Establish Wash Then 30 Seconds For Cue To Bring Up Spotlight
-Cue 3 (Series):  Wash of Blue Light Arcoss Entire Stage But With Some Fixtures textured with triangle breakway gobo pattern. Cue Time Series of 2 Second Traingle Cues That Fade in and Out. Blue Wash Now Across Entire Stage that is established in first cue of series is static
-Cue 4 (Series): Stage wash white floresant established in 3 second first cue. Series of 1 second pulsating color squares in various places on stage created by lighting shapped using shutters and colored with gels.
-Cue 5: 1 min cue slow fade up in intensity spot on orchastra.
-Cue 6: Pulsating blue lights appear in various sections on stage. Purple with swirl pattern either created by a lighting fixture with special effects. And squares of pulsesating white lights in squares shapped by shutters in similar angles as the pavement cue as earlier.
-Cue 7 & 8 30 Second Total Time. Fades Up in Intensity of Spotlight on Orchasta to Max. Than 0 Second complete take out of light in final cue of song.
