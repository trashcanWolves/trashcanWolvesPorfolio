## How the Look Might Be Achieved on Stage

-The nighttime looks show an instance of evenly lit look where a lot of details are concealed can be achieved by having stronger front lighting than you do back lighting. This might be able to be used as a good starting place when planning out the evenly lit stage looks needed for Studio Project 1; though observably with some tweaking to better balance all angles of the lighting and to not obscure figure details.

-The midday look might be achieved by a high level of front lighting and a medium level of back lighting and weak side lighting, top, and up lighting.

-The morning look might be achieved by a high level of front lighting and a high level of back lighting but weak side, top, and up lighting.
