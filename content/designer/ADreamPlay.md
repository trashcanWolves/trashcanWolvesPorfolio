A Dream Play is a journey through the in-between of the Realm of the Gods and that of the Mortals. As the rhythm of the Inferno of Death ever approaches we are taken to a dance party at a Quarantine Station, Memories of the Past Going By, Police Stopping the Opening of A Door, the Opening of a Play, the melodies of the Great and the Good of our Society and More.
