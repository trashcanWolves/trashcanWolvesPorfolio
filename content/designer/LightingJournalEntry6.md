## Scene 1 Funeral Scene Starts at 1minute 42 seconds Lighting Analysis:
-There is the use of a practical candel on a table next to the alter which is combinded with a gobo effect hitting the back wall making it look like there is smoke coming out of the candel

Candels often are used in religious cermony so the presence of a candel in this scene is fitting for the contextualization of a cermony surronding death

-Slightly Greenish back lighting behind the Rabbi with warmer tone front Lighting
This duality in colors signifies the duality between the world of the living and the world of the dead fitting for both the topic the scene itself centers around and the plays focus on the AIDS crisis

-There are white bar lights which we repeately see throughout the show as an Angelic motiff outline the set and bleading light into the room next store

## Scene 2 Starts at 2 hours 50ish minutes Ancestors of Prior's past and the arrival of the Angel Lighting Analysis:
-Back lighting used on Past versions of Prior shielding them in a cloak of shadow and helping to create a distinction between the world of the present and the world of the past in the play

-There is a practical lanturn light that lives on the nightstand of Prior
This helps to signify it is nighttime and works as a motiff for warning and a warning about the approach of the Angel that comes at the very end of part one of *Angels in America*


-There is a small pool of light that is just around the bed set piece.
This directs the audience's focus to the main center piece of this final scene of the play that being the fact that Prior has found himself within the hospital.

-There are seperate pools  on any momenyts that are being experienced seperated to help create a distinction in the overlaping timelines of the play
An example of this would be the bench with the two figures

-There is strobing of lights combinded with fog effects and then a wash of holy white light
This signals the Angel approaching

## Scene 3 Lighting Analysis Opening Scene of Part 2 14 seconds in:

-Slow fade in acommpying strong melody of drums
The fade in highlights the tension of the start of the story

-Two lights from front that cross each other and front light the podium. Back lighting also hits the podium

-All lighting is white lighting with the white back lighting being warmer than the front or key. This cast a shadow on the speaker
This helps to create an air of important to everything to speaker at the podium is saying

-There is red bar lighting in the background
This helps capture the mood of the words Aleksii is delivering in the opening monologue
