## Why the Lighting Designer in Question Was Choosen

I choose the lighting designer Tyler Micoleau in question since several of there works have always stood out to me personally when seeing photos of them in the past.

## Analysis of Lighting Design:

- Sunset created using cyc lights. Sunset goes from a gradiant of organge to red to purple of blue
- Some trees are cast in shadow while others are highlighted
- Orchestra cast in shadow

- Creating the sunset helps to highlight the timeline the baker and bakers wife our on in the story. While the shadow and highlight helps to capture the complex nature of the titular woods. All of this coming together in the finale number of Act 1 or 2 where stuff is almost wrapped up until the beanstalk grows or cinderella makes another wish.
